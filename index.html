        presented from my view point.........<br />

        <p>This site contains several untold stories from epics Ramayana and Mahabharatha.
        Reasoning for the story ie; why it happened,what are its consequences are also explained.
        All of the stories presented here are based on my collective knowledge of the epics,several
